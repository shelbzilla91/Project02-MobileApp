# Project02-MobileApp
**Concept**
A  application I made where users can share their favorite vegan/vegetarian recipes with options for food intolerances and food genre. I wanted to eventually base this application off of the grub hub app and have users be able to find local vegan/vegetarian fare around them and then be able to order. I came back to Earth and realized a side concept of that is sharing recipes, which I was able to accomplish. Having more time, I would focus on implementing a food delivery option.

**Techincal Aspects**

I used:
*Heroku
*Bulma
*Mongoose
*Mongo
*Javascript
*Handlebars
*HTML/CSS

**The Process**

At the beginning, I was shooting for the moon. I wanted a login form, to save the user information, and also wanted to specify the food allergy and genre with the recipe. That has all gone to my ice box. I had a hard time conceptually understanding the set up of controllers and the aspect of the layout of my seeds file. I had some trouble with handlebars being called correctly. The life of a developer is trial and error. As I coded along I was able to get the connections of controllers,routes,and views. I feel like this was a great learning process to understand the back end of collecting data into databases.
